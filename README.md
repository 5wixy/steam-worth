 - Fetches inventory data through API requests.
 - Calculates and displays the total inventory worth.

## Installation

1.Clone the repository and download it locally.
2.Open the project in your IDE.
3.Create a .env file and declare a variable "API_KEY" and set it to your steam API key.
4.The project runs a demo file because Steam's API request limit, open terminal and run "node app.js" for backend code and "node .\serverDeme.js" for demo server to fetch from. 
  If you want to use the real server of steam run just "node app.js" and change the variable "urlv" value to the string stated in the documentation.
5.Run the project.

## Usage
Follow steps 1-5.
Simply provide your steam id into the input field, Leave the app id as 730 (todo fix).
By default it will show my profile in case you didn't fetch from steam.
